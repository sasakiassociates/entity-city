# **Entity City**

A protoype that explores augmenting data onto physical images by rendering LIDAR tiles with Unity ECS/DOTS and visualized using Vuforia Image Tracking.

### **about**
Understanding the scale behind a 2D drawing is a common issue most people have when they look at a map. Typically a map gives a viewer a _top-down_ perspective to a space, which shows all the 3D stuff of a space to a limited 2D display. This probably helps with reading through these drawings quickly or with seeing a space holistically, but it's likely also the cause for the struggle with seeing things three-dimensionally.

The approach to this project was to help people through that visual struggle by **augmenting spatial heightmap data** onto it's related **city map**. Using simple shapes and textures can display the general form and spatial qualities of a city [similarly to this sketch by Ken Goulding](fluffysketch). To keep the simplicity of a map, the heightmap data that was sourced through LIDAR tiles was visualized to look similarly to a [_pin toy_](pintoysearch).

### **details**

- Currently this project is built with Vuforia and targets ARCore as it's main AR library
- The images used to anchor the LIDAR tiles was created and styled with MapBox
- Developed in Unity with ECS / DOTS
- LIDAR tile set data sourced by (?)

### **collaboration**
This prototype was apart of larger social project by MakeTank called [City Print](cityprint), which was focused rebuilding the standard .3dm file of Boston by [crowd sourced support](tilecheckout).
